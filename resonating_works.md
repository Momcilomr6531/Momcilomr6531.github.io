## Net Art Anthology response


A project that immediately caught my eye was Aleksandra Domanović’s Grobari. This is
because as I was scrolling through the projects, I saw the artist’s name, and I knew we
shared the same nationality. Intrigued by the possibility of his artwork resonating deeply
with my heritage, I dived right into the short documentary which is present on the learn
more page.


Grobari is a term we use in Serbia which describes hooligan fans in support of one of the
biggest football clubs in the country: Partizan. Grobari are known to be violent and have a
history of violent conduct. They were also notorious for being the epitome of nationalism,
especially during the dissolution of Yugoslavia.

The art piece, which is composed of countless pieces of papers stacked on top of each
other with only pieces of borders colored in, depicts the smoke of flares lit by Grobari. The
message can be interpreted in many ways, yet Domanović’s vision of the piece was to
portray how violence lives on, even though the nation of Yugoslavia had ceased to exist.

What does this have to do with the internet? The story is quite interesting. Back when the
internet was only an idea, each country had to have their own domain from which it can
connect to worldwide data sharing systems. Starting off as an academic pursuit for human
interconnectedness, the domain .yu for Yugoslavia was formed in Skopje, Macedonia.
Later, this domain was harnessed for more strategic reasons during the war for
independence in Yugoslavia. Well after Yugoslavia’s dissolution, the domain extension .yu
lived on until 2010. This inspired Domanović to continue the narrative of something virtual
carrying on the legacy of Yugoslavia’s violence, reminding us that we still have quite a long
way to go when it comes to achieving a society of peace in Serbia.

The PDFs of the papers used for the Grobari are still available online, offering a ‘virtual
poem’, where each paper stands as a stanza. Useless on its own, but when printed out and
put together works as a marvelous piece that emphasizes the collectivity that goes into
such violent acts of hooliganry. As a Serbian myself, I still see how my country has not left
such polarizing attitudes behind and that it is an effort of the collective to maintain such
close-minded attitudes. I feel like Domanović’s work really captures the phrase ‘strength in
numbers’ in all the wrong ways which is exactly how I see Serbia In the modern day.
Perhaps if more people saw Grobari, especially Serbs, they would understand that a little
bit of deviance is required to break boundaries and stride closer to an egalitarian utopia of
sorts.
