        <p>
            Genome editing allows us to rewrite the very code of life. CRISPR and other genetic tools enable us to correct mutations, eliminate hereditary diseases, and even enhance human traits. But should we?

        <h2>The Ethics of Genetic Perfection</h2>
        <p>
            If we can engineer intelligence, strength, and longevity, will natural human diversity disappear? Will we create a new social divideâ€”those who are genetically enhanced and those who are not?
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            "By mastering our own DNA, do we take control of evolution, or do we risk losing what makes us human?"
        </blockquote>
        <h2>The Future: A Designed Species?</h2>
        <p>
            As genome editing advances, are we on the brink of creating a tailored human race? If we eliminate flaws, do we erase individuality? The boundaries between medicine and modification are fading.
