        <!-- Introduction paragraph about cybernetics -->
        <p>
            Cybernetic enhancements bridge the gap between biology and technology, from bionic limbs to neural implants that enhance cognitive function. These innovations promise to restore lost abilities and expand human potential. But where do we draw the line?
        </p>

        <!-- Ethical question heading -->
        <h2>Are We Redefining Humanity?</h2>
        <p>
            When machines become part of us, do we remain human? As we integrate technology deeper into our bodies and minds, we begin to alter the core of human experience. Cybernetics raises profound questions about identity, autonomy, and what it means to be alive.

        <blockquote>
            "If our minds and bodies are editable, replaceable, and upgradable, do we lose the essence of what makes us human?"
        </blockquote>

        <!-- Ethical considerations heading -->
        <h2>The Ethical Horizon</h2>
        <p>
            Will cybernetic enhancements create a world divided between the enhanced and the natural? Will we become dependent on machines to compete, survive, or even feel whole? The path forward is filled with possibilitiesâ€”and dilemmas.
